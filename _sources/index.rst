   * **Strings (18% of exam)** - Complete string method mastery, encoding, text processing
   * **Object-Oriented Programming (34% of exam)** - Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, introspection
   * **Advanced Functions & Data Processing (22% of exam)** - Closures, decorators, map/filter/zip, file I/O, sorting algorithms

   **Course Features:**

   * 34 comprehensive chapters covering 100% of PCAP exam topics
   * Advanced coding exercises with instant feedback
   * Object-oriented programming projects
   * Real-world applications and best practices
   * Practice assessments aligned with PCAP exam format
