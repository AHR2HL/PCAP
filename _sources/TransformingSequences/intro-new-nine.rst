Introduction: Advanced String Operations
========================================

As a PCEP-certified Python programmer, you already know:

* Strings are immutable sequences of characters
* Basic string operations (indexing, slicing, concatenation)
* Common string methods (upper, lower, split, join, strip, replace)
* String formatting with .format() and f-strings

This chapter builds on that foundation to complete your string mastery for PCAP certification.

What You'll Learn in This Chapter
----------------------------------

**Complete String Method Reference (PCAP Section 3 - 18%)**

Python has over 40 string methods. In PCEP, you learned the most common ones. Now you'll master ALL of them, including:

* **Advanced case manipulation:** capitalize(), title(), swapcase(), casefold()
* **Alignment & padding:** center(), ljust(), rjust(), zfill()
* **Advanced searching:** rfind(), rindex(), partition(), rpartition()
* **Character validation:** isalnum(), isalpha(), isdigit(), isdecimal(), isnumeric(), isidentifier()
* **Text processing:** expandtabs(), splitlines(), maketrans(), translate()

**Why This Matters**

Professional Python developers work extensively with text data:

* Web scraping and data cleaning
* User input validation
* Log file analysis
* Natural language processing
* Configuration file parsing

Mastering string methods makes you significantly more efficient at these tasks.

**Before You Continue**

This chapter assumes you're comfortable with:

* Mutability and immutability
* References and aliasing
* Basic string operations

If you need a quick refresher on these concepts, review the next two sections. Otherwise, skip directly to the Complete String Methods Reference.
